# Physics for Computer Science
## TOPIC 1:
Write a code (python or java or MS excel or any other language) to calculate various properties of a trajectory motion.The guidance for the initial values are given as follows:
- The initial velocity is calculated as twice the value formed by the 3rd and 4th digits in your student ID number. For instance, if your ID is 20230808602, the initial velocity would be 23 * 2 = 46 m/s. Similarly, for an ID like 20210808033, the velocity would be 21 * 2 = 42 m/s.
The initial angle with the horizontal axis is determined by the last two digits of your student number. If the last two
digits are less than 20, add 20 to the number. For instance, if your student number is 20230808602, the initial angle
will be 20 + 02 = 22 degrees. Similarly, for an ID like 20210808033, the angle will be 33 degrees.
- Take g=9.8 m/s^2 for this question.
- Plot the trajectory of the projectile motion. X vs Y
- Calculate and print out the time of flight, the maximum height and the range of the of the projectile motion with
your code.
## TOPIC 2:
Use programming to demonstrate to solve another problem from Physics I topics. Any subject is fine (linear motion, rotational motion, work and energy, torque, moment of inertia, conservation of   linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum etc.)


### Here some useful class - packages and finally results:
